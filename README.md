# lox_lang
Lox is an interpreted dynamic programming language that made and implemented entirely in C#.
It's based on specification of [JLox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) (Java-based implementation) but with intention to add more features.

## Implemetation Roadmap:
The project is still work in progress, I'm working on the following major phases:

- [x] Scanning Phase
- [ ] Representing Code
- [ ] Parsing Expressions
- [ ] Evaluating Expressions
- [ ] Statement and State
- [ ] Control Flow
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Resolving and Binding
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Inheritance

## Documentation
There is extensive XML documentation comments written inside Lox in its implementation with C#. Public APIs will be published once project get finished.
